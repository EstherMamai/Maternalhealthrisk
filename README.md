# Maternal Health Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
Maternal health is a crucial aspect of public health, and early detection of potential risks can help improve outcomes for both mothers and infants. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict maternal health risks based on key health indicators. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with an assistive tool for risk assessment, enabling timely intervention and better decision-making.

## Features
- **Predict maternal health risk levels** based on patient health indicators.
- **Machine learning model trained on maternal health data**.
- **Data preprocessing and feature engineering** for enhanced model accuracy.
- **Interpretability tools** for better understanding of model predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains key health parameters including:
- Age
- Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
- Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)
- Blood Sugar Level
- Body Temperature
- Heart Rate

The target variable is the maternal health risk level, categorized as **low, moderate, or high risk**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage
The model is developed and trained using Google Colab. To use the notebook:
1. Open Google Colab and upload the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the appropriate cells.
3. Load the dataset into the notebook.
4. Run the preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Model Training
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize numerical features
2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify important features using correlation analysis
3. **Model Selection & Training:**
   - Train models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-world clinical data for better generalization.
- Improve model explainability using SHAP values.
- Implement real-time data monitoring for adaptive learning.
